## Electric Vehicle Infrastructure

This app uses data from NREL and the U.S. Census Bureau.
Currently, this app takes about 10-15 seconds to load because of the size of data that is being read and rendered into the map.

However, this app will be updated soon for faster performance.

The app is housed here: [https://jeffrey-scanlon.shinyapps.io/FinalProject_JScanlon/](https://jeffrey-scanlon.shinyapps.io/FinalProject_JScanlon/)
